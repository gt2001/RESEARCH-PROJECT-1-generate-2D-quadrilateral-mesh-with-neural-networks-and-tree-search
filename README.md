Present performance:

Pentagonal plate: 0.9106 (5.3204% better than ABAQUS: 0.8646, 1.4822% better than FreeMesh-S: 0.8973)

Seed-density-changing rectangle: 0.8011 (13.8573% better than ABAQUS: 0.7036)

----- Update log -----

11.19.2021[1]: Fixed the problem in [delete.bat] that does not delete record text files every time.

11.20.2021[2]: Added the force-choice mechanism in [PPO.ipynb] that gives the agent 2 chances to choose type 0 in an episode. This also leads to a higher search efficiency in [MCTS.ipynb].

11.20.2021[3]: Added an input box before launching [delete.bat] in [PPO.ipynb] to avoid deleting/replacing records by mistake.

11.21.2021[4]: Optimized [PPO.ipynb] to accelerate calculation speed.

11.21.2021[5]: Updated [MCTS.ipynb] to fit the new mechanism in [PPO.ipynb]
